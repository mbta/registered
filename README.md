# Registered

A set of scripts for working with TransitMaster. Reference the rating process documentation [here](https://github.com/mbta/wiki/blob/master/transit_tech/Procedures/TransitMaster/TM-03_Make_Updates.md). 

**Effect:**	Different steps throughout the rating process. Allows data validation before importing into TransitMaster.
**Circumstances:**	As needed. Generally once per quarterly rating.  
**Required Skills:**	None  
**Required Tools:**	VPN access, a text editor, access to TM databases 

## Setup

Reminder: Before the set-up process, clone the registered repository and make sure you're working within it. 

### Linux/MacOS
```
$ brew install proj freetds
$ asdf install
$ asdf reshim
$ pip install pipenv
$ pipenv install  # --dev if you want to do development on the scripts
```

### Windows
```
$ choco install pyenv-win
$ pyenv install
$ pyenv rehash
$ pip install pipenv
$ pipenv install  # --dev if you want to do development on the scripts
```

## HASTUS sync

Sync a HASTUS export to the TransitMaster server, validating the data in the process.

- Writes the data to `support/ratings/*` for later processing if needed.
- Will prompt for your AD password, or you can put it in the `AD_PASSWORD` environment
  variable.

```
$ pipenv run hastus_sync (if testing, use "â€”no-push" to avoid actually updating the rating data on the TM server)
```

## Scripts 

For the scripts below, you will have to access the rating folder on hstmtest01 on your local machine to direct it to the right path. If you're working from a PC computer, you are all set. If you're working from a MAC, follow the instructions below. 

### Linux/MacOS
- From your MAC, open finder
- Click 'Go' 
- Click 'Connect to Server' 
- Type 'smb://HSTMTEST01/c$/Ratings' 
- Access the files at '/Volumes/Ratings/[Rating]' (i.e. /Volumes/Ratings/Winter12202020) 


## Merge

Merge a set of rating files together in the Combine directory. This step is found under TM-03.05, step 2 in [TransitMaster New Rating Procedure] 

Writes the merged files to `<rating>.pat`, `<rating>.nde`, &c.

```
$ pipenv run merge <path to Rating/Combine>
```

## Validate

Validate that the rating files are correct. This step is found under TM-03.05, step 4 (Integrity Checker) in [TransitMaster New Rating Procedure]

Exits with 1 if there were any errors.

```
$ pipenv run validate <path to Rating/Combine or Rating/Combine/HASTUS_export>
```

## Calendar

Print a CSV which has the service information for each garage, by date. This step is meant to help facilitate TM-03.05, step 7 in [TransitMaster New Rating Procedure]

```
$ pipenv run calendar <path to Rating/Combine or Rating/Combine/HASTUS_export>
```

## Cheat Sheet

Print a summary of the relevant dates/services for the rating.

```
$ pipenv run calendar <path to Rating/Combine/HASTUS_export>
```

## Stop Comparison

Print a CSV which shows new/changed stops between two ratings. This step is found under TM-03.06, step 1 in [TransitMaster New Rating Procedure]

- Copy .env.template to .env and fill out at least the first three variables with the TransitMaster DB server information from 1Password.
```
$ pipenv run stop_comparison <path to current Rating/Combine> <path to next Rating/Combine>
```
